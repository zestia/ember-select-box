# Changelog

## 15.3.2 (not yet published)

- Doesn't render `aria-multiselectable=false`, when not relevant

## 15.3.1

- Upgrade dependencies
- Strip whitespace from inside empty elements, to allow CSS `:empty`

- Allow `Space` to select an option similar to `Enter`

## 15.2.0

- Upgrade dependencies
- Add Embroider support
- Where possible, `keyup` is [preferred](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/blob/master/docs/rule/no-down-event-binding.md) over `keydown`

## 15.1.3

- Upgrade dependencies

- Upgrade dependencies

## 15.0.0-beta-8

- Add regression test for typeahead with repeating character

## 15.0.0-beta-7

## 15.0.0-beta.3

- Removed `data-` attributes, `@classNamePrefix` and `@onBuildClassName` in a bid to reduce API surface
- Removed stateful BEM class names, like `select-box__option--selected` in favour of aria attributes
- Removed `onInsertElement` (`@onReady` suffices)
- Removed `sb.Group` for native select box. `optgroup` can be used instead
- Removed `@onInput` from `sb.Input` component. This action wasn't providing anything different than what can be acheived by using `{{on "input"}}`
- Removed ability to set a `@value` on a selected option, and activate that selected option.
- `SelectedOption`, `SelectedOptions`, `Group` and `Options` are now just dumb template only components. They weren't removed altogether, because they still prove useful for higher order components with the component helper.
- Upgrade dependencies

## 15.0.0-beta.2

- Fix debounced searched attempts if `@searchDelayTime` is 0

## 15.0.0-beta.1

- Small internal refactor around focusing

## 15.0.0-beta.0

- Remove `onFocusIn` and `onFocusOut` actions, these don't provide anything different than what can be acheived by using `{{on "focusin"}}` and `{{on "focusout"}}`.
- Add `onFocusLeave` which fires when focus leaves the select box. This is useful for closing the select box when tabbing away.
- Remove `onClickOutside` in favour of `onFocusLeave`. (This removed the need for event listeners on the document).

## 9.0.1

- Upgrade dependencies
- Remove jQuery from dummy test app

## 9.0.0

## 6.1.3

- Fixes to the demos

## 6.1.2

## 6.1.0

- Update to use named arguments
- Fix use of `.send` on destroyed/ing component

## 6.0.4

- Expose `isOpen` state on the yielded API as well as the template API.

## 6.0.3

- Fix an issue introduced in 6.0.2 where mousing over an option would cause it to be scrolled to.
- Updated readme to better explain the behaviour of the `activate` actions.

## 6.0.2

- `activateNextOption` and `activatePreviousOption` default to scrolling the parent element.
  So there is no longer the requirement to pass in `true`, like `sb.activateNextOption(true)`. But,
  you can of course send in false if you don't want this behaviour.

- Adds a new API function `activateOptionForKeyCode` which will make your select box behave more
  like a native selectbox, in that by typing characters an option whose `textContent` matches will be
  activated. It may not be suitable to use this feature if the selectbox also has an input field as the
  behaviours will likely conflict, but this will depend on your usecase.

## 6.0.1

- Fixes test helpers that select multiple options

## 6.0.0

- Improvements to aria attributes
  (Corrects listbox role. Adds combobox role when appropriate. Adds aria-busy)

- Removes jQuery from test suite

## 5.0.0

- Option's yielded properties are now prefixed with `is`, e.g. `{{o.isSelected}}`

- Option label attribute has been removed to align better with native select boxes. To migrate, change `{{sb.option label="Foo"}}` to `{{#sb.option}}Foo{{/sb.option}}`. [More](https://github.com/zestia/ember-select-box/issues/9#issuecomment-370250705).

- Selected box now yields promise state of the value, e.g. `isPending`, `isRejected`, `isFulfilled`, `isSettled`

- Native select box option now uses same template as Faux select box option template.

## 4.2.3

- Internal changes
- One way value attributes

## 4.2.2

- Remove `invokeAction` util

## 4.2.1

- `value` for a multiple select can now be a promise for an array, whereas originally it was always
  expecting an array.
- Removes `on-build-selection` from native select component

## 4.2.0

- Previously, the behaviour of selecting multiple options with the faux-select component was
  undefined. With the intention that developers use `sb.update(myValues)` to implement the multiple
  behaviour they want. But, it is rare you want anything other than to mimic a native select, by
  toggling the selected item from the array of values. Hence this is now the default behaviour.
  More info: https://github.com/zestia/ember-select-box/pull/15. A new action `on-build-selection`
  allows you to customise this.

- When using a multiple select box, the `on-select` action will fire with an array of the selected
  values. This array is frozen, and is not the same as the one passed into the select box originally.

## 4.1.0

- Changes `scrollIntoView` signature. Now finds the first scrollable parent, and scrolls that
  rather than assuming the select box options will be the scrollable element.
